            <p>Personal data (which for this survey consists of only your contact details) will be stored confidentially using University of Nottingham storage, using Microsoft Sharepoint which allows us to store the data in a password protected and encrypted storage. We will only keep your contact details after the survey has completed if you are interested in being involved in future research (we will ask you this specifically in the survey).</p>
            
            <p>We do not store or ask for any other personal data such as your child's name, date of birth, or your name. The survey team will have access to contact details and survey data, but no other medical data. We do not link any data from this survey to other records or databases. The survey team does not and will not have access to any medical records (such as hospital records) for your child. After the survey has completed, we will provide anonymised reports (not including any personal data) to the hospital where you had your sleep study.</p>
            
            <p>We may decide to discuss the result of this survey in publications (both internal and external). We will however not identify individuals in these publications, but will produce summaries (for example describing the average opinion of people who filled in the survey).</p>
            
            <p>All survey data will be stored for a minimum of 7 years after publication or public release of the survey results.
